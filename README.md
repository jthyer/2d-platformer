I made the basic engine for this in March. I kept wanting to come back to it,
but I got stuck because the main thing I was interested in exploring was having 
really mean kaizo mario-style regrab jumps. I thought that'd be alienating for
most players, so I didn't actually care that much about fleshing it out into a 
"full game", like Jellyfish Archipelago. 

The presentation here is inspired by a bunch of Sylvie's tiny hard platformers, 
where the game zeroes in on one interesting friction and then immediately ends. 
I think that's a really neat mode of gamedev, and posting on Glorious 
Trainwrecks instead of itch (and not having to make a goddam title thumbnail) 
is helping me feel more free to explore this kind of sketch dev.
